function r = myEuclideanGcdGF2(a, b)
% Find the greatest common divisor using Euclidean Algorithm
% Input:
%   a: polynomial coefficient in order of ascending power
%      the highest(rightest position is 1)
%   b: polynomial coefficient in order of ascending power
%      the highest(rightest position is 1)
% Ouput:
%   r: the greatest common divisor 
%      the highest(rightest position is 1)
%      polynomial coefficient in order of ascending power
